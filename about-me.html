                            Hello, my name is Ryan Torres and for the last 5 years, I have been working to sharpen my game development skills. I have taken numerous programming classes, starting from 
                            the very basics of printing "Hello World!" to making a custom engine for an original game with a team of only 3 other people. I have gone to Full Sail University in Florida 
                            to study Game Development and recieve my Bachelors in Computer Science. Throughout my schooling, I applied my passion for creation and technology into every project I was a part of.
                            I worked both solo and as a team to create a multitude of 3D-rendered, ineractible scenes and games (see <a href="index.html#first">Projects)</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I am not working to better my skills as a developer, I fill my free time by, of course, playing games! I play mostly first-person shooters, but I enjoy all sorts of
                            genres, including puzzle, rogue-like, and sandbox games. Games like these is what molded my interest in game development, which is why I spent a huge chunk of my
                            education learning the backend development cycle, showing me how exactly these experiences came to be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my journey, I have gained quite of bit of knowledge, but I do not plan on stopping there. Whether it is by following tutorials, forming a team, or doing my own solo projects,
                            I insist on tackling new learning oppurtuninities to help better myself as a developer.
                        </p>
